# Questions I have:

## Training Materials for Phish Training vs Examination of SAT more
My main problem has been not knowing which would be "appropriate" for a portfolio. It is a writing program, so I'm hoping a website with written research would be fine, but I'm unsure given the proposal I had done.

### How would I do it?
If I choose to chase the SAT research, I would have to address each part of my proposal that I did not end up doing by explaining:

1. Why I thought I was going to do it originally
2. Why I decided not to based on what I've learned


### Rationale and explanation:
I'm not switching projects, I'm switching deliverables for Part II. 

I've found that by claiming to make an "improved" SAT and demonstrating this through phishing, I'm creating something that I've dicsovered to be inherently problematic in SATs to begin with. 

Making a rhetorically-focused SAT that's focused on only phishing undermines the project's intentions of creating a "better" SAT, because part of the problem with SATs are that many masquerade as SAT programs but only focus on phishing. I don't want to ruin my credibility as a researcher and hopeful future professional by doing the very thing that is undermining SAT and cybersecurity in the corporate sphere already.

So because of this, I want to use Part II (phase II) to discuss awareness training, the issues surrounding it, how they intersect with other issues, and what could be done about it. 

Since the main problems with SAT are in the realm of communication, I still feel this satisfies the rhetorical requirement, especially when analyzing how that communication (and subsequent breakdown) creates these issues and what could be done to fix it. 


### If still uncomfortable:
I can still do what I wrote about in my proposal, with the caveat being I would discuss how it's problematic. Knowing though that I would be creating something that is problematic, I'd prefer not to have to spend the time making these things, but will do so if it's required to graduate.


# From Sharon:

## REVISION is first and foremost with the conversation
Feeling existential dread during the revision process is normal, and she'd like to talk about it

- A lot of stuff seemed like it was leading up to what I was doing as opposed to what I had done
- So where's the project, then?

Who is my audience?
- Seems like I'm talking to clients? But unsure
- Audience is too general? The "you" feels like I'm not getting to the point.
- Make my audience intentional. 
	- Lack of clarity and audience is causing the problem.
		- Find out who I'm talking to, and then the direction will help find itself
		- The 'cup holder' area at the thing 
	- Pass through the writing looking for audience - who is my audience?
		- Reframe the writings to be
- Write about my audience
	- Talk about the things I've thought about and who I'm writing for?

"There is" is not a good phrase - doesn't have meaning, so rewrite so the sentences have meaning. 

Cut the "their is" and try to reassemble sentences to make it better.

Primary Audience: The committee
Secondary Audience: Clients and/or other researchers?

Justified text is probably not good

The way I use "you" is offensive? idk

"hold your hand" feels disrespectful - this is an othering statement

## The Method
- Write the thing that goes to the public
	- Because it will mean more than just 

## Read some of what I wrote out loud to hear how I "sound"
How to figure out what I'm stuck on and how to revise by reading it outloud.


## Imposter Syndrome
Don't worry about it lol

## What *actually* needs to get written, because I might have enough


## I'm not constructing myself as the enemy, and that's good.

## Focus of Scale?
-Thesis instead of portfolio?

## Public-facing portfolio
Audience: someone who knows enough who'd be looking for that information, and to be a seat at the table versus an adversary

Someone's looked up phishing, interested in phishing

Educational website - audience is the user who's looking for this information

Define for this porject, who my audience is, and define it.

A person who has googled phishing emails

## Anxiety and Writing
if I can remember the undermining of intelligence, efficacy, etc. 

# Wednesday
Is there anything getting in the way of the "what's going to happen next" conversation that Sunday?


# Audience

Project has an audience split:
- Someone who is looking for information on phishing emails
- Someone who wants information on security awareness training

But someone who wants phishing emails *and* security awareness training is who?
- The cybersecurity researcher?

Red & Blue Team look at the same data from different vantage points -> cybersecurity researcher -> anyone who *needs* information on it -> Hackers. 

My audience is hackers.

**My audience are hackers and researchers interested in phishing and security from a perspective that isn't corporately biased.**
