# Portfolio Rewrite
Version 2.0

Major revision, six weeks left. Removing client and academic focus, working on public-facing porfolio and writing for my audience. Twice weekly check-ins with advisor.

# General Housekeeping
You've got some things to work on, don't you Jen?

## Audience
My audience is someone who is both interested in phishing emails and security awareness training. They could be a researcher, a professional, or a hobbyist...but what it boils down to is "hacker."  My audience is hackers interested in a non-corporate take on security. 
Should reframe the whole business thing in this, then, I think. Maybe get rid of it for now since we're still up and coming.

## Aesthetic Fixes

1. Background color, thinking of taking inspiration from frack with a lime green touch as opposed to the red. Like a cool grey terminal with white text and black and green bars still. Maybe. Not sure.
2. Right-justified on web, especially in current design. I should find a more readable font. Tracking problems.
3. Make font size a bit bigger in the  body, I think it's 16 now.
4. Maybe find a different background gif :( Will do this with redisgn most likely.

Font ideas:
1. Courier Prime

Color theme ideas:
-Dark/black bg with 

greens:
- 42C01C

## Remove

1. Phase designations - I need to come up with a better way of organizing thoughts. Nodes has come to mind a bit.
2. Creative works, maybe. 
3. Providentia Security?

## Add

# Introduction

## The Landing Page

### New landing page

What do I want?
- To ask tough and unconventional questions.
- A space to share ideas.
- To be taken seriously.
- To bring something valuable to both rhetoric and cybersecurity fields.
- To still be personable in writing.
- To find my voice.
- To find who I am.

What don't I want?
- To be an adversary.
- To belittle others in pursuit of my goal.
- To lose myself in this project.

### Old writing:
This website hosts my master's portfolio project, among other things I've worked on. What's in here is mostly writing for now. I'm currently a master's candidate for a Rhetoric and Writing degree at Saint Cloud State University. Because I am a huge propoent of open source, I feel that the type of work I have been interested in [digital spaces] is more suited to a digital space than a standard thesis. I am much more open to the idea of having easily accessible knowledge and building a community, rather than hiding behind paywalls or other types of barriers. I am a huge proponent of Open Source, and feel that education should follow the same path.

I've thought a lot about both rhetoric and cybersecurity, and I believe a meaningful relationship exists between them. It's the perfect marriage of disciplines, and I feel it should be focused on seriously if we want to promote technological literacy - not just in the workplace, but overall. I aim to push that conversation in the right direction with this project. Currently, access to portfolio content is restricted to my committee. I expect an approval for publication date near December 2019. I intend on releasing my project to the wild when I have approval. If you have questions about what I am working on, or have worked on in the past (or even just want to say hello,) please see my about me page for contact methods. I'm more than happy to talk about anything I'm working on. â™«
