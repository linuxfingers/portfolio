# Portfolio Rewrite
Version 2.0

Major revision, six weeks left. Removing client and academic focus, working on public-facing portfolio and writing for my audience. Twice weekly check-ins with advisor.

# General Housekeeping
You've got some things to work on, don't you Jen?

# From Sharon:

## REVISION is first and foremost with the conversation
Feeling existential dread during the revision process is normal, and she'd like to talk about it

- A lot of stuff seemed like it was leading up to what I was doing as opposed to what I had done
- So where's the project, then?

Who is my audience?
- Seems like I'm talking to clients? But unsure
- Audience is too general? The "you" feels like I'm not getting to the point.
- Make my audience intentional.
	- Lack of clarity and audience is causing the problem.
		- Find out who I'm talking to, and then the direction will help find itself
		- The 'cup holder' area at the thing
	- Pass through the writing looking for audience - who is my audience?
		- Reframe the writings to be
- Write about my audience
	- Talk about the things I've thought about and who I'm writing for?

"There is" is not a good phrase - doesn't have meaning, so rewrite so the sentences have meaning.

Cut the "their is" and try to reassemble sentences to make it better.

Primary Audience: The committee
Secondary Audience: Clients and/or other researchers?

Justified text is probably not good

The way I use "you" is offensive? idk

"hold your hand" feels disrespectful - this is an othering statement

## The Method
- Write the thing that goes to the public
	- Because it will mean more than just

## Read some of what I wrote out loud to hear how I "sound"
How to figure out what I'm stuck on and how to revise by reading it outloud.


## Imposter Syndrome
Don't worry about it lol

## What *actually* needs to get written, because I might have enough

## I'm not constructing myself as the enemy, and that's good.

## Focus of Scale?
-Thesis instead of portfolio?

## Public-facing portfolio
Audience: someone who knows enough who'd be looking for that information, and to be a seat at the table versus an adversary

Someone's looked up phishing, interested in phishing

Educational website - audience is the user who's looking for this information

Define for this porject, who my audience is, and define it.

A person who has googled phishing emails

## Anxiety and Writing
if I can remember the undermining of intelligence, efficacy, etc.

## Wednesday
Is there anything getting in the way of the "what's going to happen next" conversation that Sunday?

# Audience

Project has an audience split:
- Someone who is looking for information on phishing emails
- Someone who wants information on security awareness training

But someone who wants phishing emails *and* security awareness training is who?
- The cybersecurity researcher?

Red & Blue Team look at the same data from different vantage points -> cybersecurity researcher -> anyone who *needs* information on it -> Hackers.

My audience is hackers.

**My audience are hackers and researchers interested in phishing and security from a perspective that isn't corporately biased.**

## Audience
My audience is someone who is both interested in phishing emails and security awareness training. They could be a researcher, a professional, or a hobbyist...but what it boils down to is "hacker."  My audience is hackers interested in a non-corporate take on security.
Should reframe the whole business thing in this, then, I think. Maybe get rid of it for now since we're still up and coming.

## Aesthetic Fixes

1. Background color, thinking of taking inspiration from frack with a lime green touch as opposed to the red. Like a cool grey terminal with white text and black and green bars still. Maybe. Not sure.
2. Right-justified on web, especially in current design. I should find a more readable font. Tracking problems.
3. Make font size a bit bigger in the  body, I think it's 16 now.
4. Maybe find a different background gif :( Will do this with redisgn most likely.

Font ideas:
1. Courier Prime

Color theme ideas:
-Dark/black bg with

greens:
- 42C01C

## Remove

1. Phase designations - I need to come up with a better way of organizing thoughts. Nodes has come to mind a bit.
2. Creative works, maybe.
3. Providentia Security?

## Add

## New organization

# Introduction

## The Landing Page

### New landing page

What do I want?
- To ask tough and unconventional questions.
- A space to share ideas.
- To be taken seriously.
- To bring something valuable to both rhetoric and cybersecurity fields.
- To still be personable in writing.
- To find my voice.
- To find who I am.

What don't I want?
- To be an adversary.
- To belittle others in pursuit of my goal.
- To lose myself in this project.

### Old writing:
This website hosts my master's portfolio project, among other things I've worked on. What's in here is mostly writing for now. I'm currently a master's candidate for a Rhetoric and Writing degree at Saint Cloud State University. Because I am a huge propoent of open source, I feel that the type of work I have been interested in [digital spaces] is more suited to a digital space than a standard thesis. I am much more open to the idea of having easily accessible knowledge and building a community, rather than hiding behind paywalls or other types of barriers. I am a huge proponent of Open Source, and feel that education should follow the same path.

I've thought a lot about both rhetoric and cybersecurity, and I believe a meaningful relationship exists between them. It's the perfect marriage of disciplines, and I feel it should be focused on seriously if we want to promote technological literacy - not just in the workplace, but overall. I aim to push that conversation in the right direction with this project. Currently, access to portfolio content is restricted to my committee. I expect an approval for publication date near December 2019. I intend on releasing my project to the wild when I have approval. If you have questions about what I am working on, or have worked on in the past (or even just want to say hello,) please see my about me page for contact methods. I'm more than happy to talk about anything I'm working on. â™«

If you have access, please click "login $USER" at the top of the page to access the portfolio. Otherwise, enjoy the links in the footer. You'll find information about me, my previous writings, artwork, and music.
