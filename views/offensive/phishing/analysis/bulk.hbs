  Bulk phishing is a common tactic which uses impersonation, threats, and urgent language to obtain information and credentials from their victims. As the name implies, bulk phishing works by sending out multiple copies of the same email to anyone and everyone, regardless of whether or not there is an existing business relationship with the victim. While tempting to think of them as clones, bulk phishing emails are not clonephishing attempts as they do not outright mimic official emails, but rather design them based on existing emails to illicit an emotional response. This designation is important, as these phishing attempts rely on the attacker's ability to create provoking and trustworthy writings to be successful versus relying on an existing brand's official communications. Since phishing relies on FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) to get the message across that the victim <i>needs</i> to act now or they're in jeopardy, for bulk phishing to be successful it needs to expertly employ this strategy to a wide audience in order to be successful. Any inclination that the author is not who they say they are through improper use of language, visuals, or overly-dramatic threats can easily cause a crack in the illusion being portrayed, rending the attack ineffective.

<h3># rhetorical situation</h3>
<p>
  Bulk phishing emails are not personalized, even if they claim to be, and may only reference general information that may or may not be connected to the victim, and operate by giving a notice, alert, or issue with a customer's account or activity has come up. The intended recipient was assumed to have been a customer of the company contacting them, either randomly targetted or contacted due to recent account activity. Recurring themes in bulk phishing include incorrect account information, unauthorized access attempts from foreign IPs, or unauthorized purchases. Generally all of these "infractions" result in a violation to account policies or procedures that require urgent attention or the victim's account will be terminated.

<p>
  The email's form generally complemented the content. Logo placement and text styling appear correct on most of the emails. The main ideas of the message correspond well with the form of business communication, but there are areas with glaring errors that break the illusion. In one example, the text states: "We will be upgrading our yearly SSL EncryptedServer to prevent fraudulent activity." [amazon 3] "EncryptedServer" looks strange, because it is. This isn't an "actual" thing for one, and secondly, a quick Google search of "SSL EncryptedServer" pulled up only phishing email examples from various sources exactly like this one. Oops. But knowing these are intended for people to make quick responses to, would the victims even notice these errors? Especially when you consider emails such as the free pet in World of Warcraft - if the victim is an active player, they might be too excited to notice that it doesn't even say who sent the email! [warcraft] Even with these errors, many of these emails have been so convincing, they're challenging to tell apart from legitimate emails so in that respect, the emails convey their manufactured intent effectively.
</p>

<h3># rhetorical appeals</h3>
<p>
  Bulk phishing email's credibility (ethos) is established through the use of brand logos, legal text, and formal language by identifying with the victim through an existing business relationship, establishing itself as legitimate. By communicating to the victim as a "member" and highlighting the importance of privacy and security, it creates a sense of trust that allows the victim to let their guard down. There is often mention that the email cannot be replied to, as it is unmonitored, which is a pretty standard formality within business communications. Many of these bulk emails use logos and other images hotlinked directly to the company's servers the phishers are pretending to be. It can be an effective way to mask the phisher's intent if the images are still able to be loaded as it "proves" the email is from whomever the attack is pretending to be. The downside is that it also has the capability to dismantle the operation immediately if crucial images aren't loaded. Authority is asserted through forceful and strong language, lack of emotional influence, and links or quotations of various policies within the company, presenting the author as concerned with the privacy of its users and the safety of the community, but unafraid to use legal force or threat of account termination to obtain the necessary information to run its business.

<p>
  While the tone of bulk phishing attacks tend to be formal, they do express urgency and evoke emotional responses through threatening language. For example, these Amazon emails [amazon 2 & amazon 4] issue legal-sounding notices to the victim that they're violating terms of the User Agreement and are at risk of being terminated. The language used in many of these emails is irrational given the context. Why would a company use terminating an account as punishment for unauthorized access attempts to no fault of the customer's?  The arguments made in the emails state it is a security measure, and hit hard on ideas of presenting shared values of privacy, safety, and maintaining the existing business relationship with the victim, but often the presentation is convoluted and doesn't follow a logical customer-business relationship. Sometimes the attackers go so far as to implicate the recipient in being a potential cause for the community having less integrity as a ploy upon the need for people to want to feel "good" or upstanding [Amazon 2], with the recipient needing to act on this matter if they want to retain positive qualities. If the attacker had done less overt threatening, and more gentle guiding towards confirmation or reassurance, the attack would raise less eyebrows to someone questioning its legitimacy.

  An unusual (but effective) use of emotional appeals appeared in an eBay email stating they were closing the service due to "repeated abuses on their company." The email instructs the victim to vote in a survey on if feel eBay should remain open. At the bottom of the message, it stated the reason the victim received the email is due to their "good account standing." It's flattering the victim's ego based on their perceived value to the eBay Community. [eBay 4] The idea behind this type of attack is to make the victim panic that something they love, and are valued by, is going away because of "other people messing it up." By asking for the victim's input, it makes them feel valuable, and their input could potentially "save" eBay from going under. Having a survey as a bulk phish is a great way to easily harvest credentials, but the glaring gramattical errors and strange conventions ultimately lead this particular example to fall flat.
</p>
<p>
  These extreme (and upon examination, unreasonable) threats are successful because fear pushes the victim to act quickly without thinking about what's happening. They could be even more successful if they honed their language towards typical communicative practices from the organization as opposed to simply fear-mongering, and a few attempt to do that. Even so, recognizing that invoking an emotional response in the reader through jeopardizing something presumably valueable is an effective mode of attack, and one that should be addressed on the defensive side.
</p>
<p>
  Often these emails also use logos (the rhetorical appeal, not branding) to try and reason with the user. Examples of this include statements such as a victim's account information being invalid due to verification issues during payment, which appear as a straightforward follow-up. But the email's ethos is disrupted when they attempt to make the user feel bad about particular actions, such as being a "bad" Amazon community member for not having their information up to date. It doesn't make sense logically, and rely on a "slippery slope" argument, which states that because their information is out of date, they are at risk of having their account terminated. A business would not would forcefully shut down someone's account for typing in something incorrectly; they would verify the information instead. Another example is from the eBay example above which states their "registered name is included to show this message originated from eBay, " but it's addressed to "eBay Community." A strange name for a person, but seeing as these are meant to illicit a reactionary response as opposed to thinking about the content, it's an effective mass-market phishing attempt seen as legitimate by identifying corporate markers of "safety." [eBay 4] This email is an excellent example of how a quick and straightforward (logical) request, which likely prompted the victim to "log in" to submit their survey response, can open up someone to having their information stolen.

<h3># simulation</h3>
<p>
  Most bulk phishing appear as standard business communications, following that genre's form and conventions quite well with minimal emotive language, vague yet formal communications, and consistent mentions of privacy, safety, and copyrights. What seems to be the biggest issue with these emails is visual inconsistencies that break the simulation they're projecting. However, there are a few glaring formatting and grammatical errors that take away from the presentation of the message, such as "If you do not update your billing informations your access on Amazon features will be restricted and the user deleted." [amazon 1] A phishing email's disguise is quickly dismantled with poor grammar and images in the wrong places. [Chase 1] Other breaks in the illusion have been formatting concerns, with footer placement broken into sections or the use of a plain-text link, or using plain text as opposed to a company's logo. It's a disappointment, because many of these emails could be effective with minimal effort on the phisher's part.
</p>
<p>
  Since these emails intend to phish, and not inform or protect, they simulate legitimate links or information with the malicious (and the real intention) hidden underneath. Often the email header shows the email "From:" field originates from a legitimate source but the email address is something completely different. My favorite example I found in the Enron Dataset was sent from Trashcan G. Straitjacket representing Chase from the email aw-confirm@chase.com [chase4]. It's evident from a variety of angles that the email sent by Trashcan is not a real email from Chase Bank, but the language they used in the email was sophisticated and threatening enough that those details may have been overlooked. By simulating the attacker is someone trustworthy, the email becomes real.

  Bulk phishing relies on existing business communications with the victim and the ability to mimic those communications well. The attacks have gotten more sophisticated, and the ability to mask links through services such as bit.ly and others only make detecting these in both spam filters and the individual more difficult. Some attacks use gentle persuasion, but most bulk phishing attempts are aggressive in describing what the recipient has done wrong and how to fix it, trying to force the audience to act on impulse. Other times it is unbiased and informative, attempting persuasion through the presentation of facts with an easy solution such as the account becoming locked due to multiple incorrect login attempts, or an order failed due to billing information. Overbearing threats of closure, compromise, and illigetimacy with the right combination of persuasive language makes bulk phishing attempts incredibly successful. But while fear-based aggression garners an immediate emotional response, an email that gives a wide audience nothing to think about, with an easy solution presented to them, is a much more effective tactic.
