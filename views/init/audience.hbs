Project has an audience split:
- Someone who is looking for information on phishing emails
- Someone who wants information on security awareness training

But someone who wants phishing emails *and* security awareness training is who?
- The cybersecurity researcher?

Red & Blue Team look at the same data from different vantage points -> cybersecurity researcher -> anyone who *needs* information on it -> Hackers.

My audience is hackers.

**My audience is hackers and researchers interested in phishing and security from a perspective that isn't corporately biased.**
