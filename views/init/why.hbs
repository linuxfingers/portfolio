<h1>&Vert; why this is important</h1>
<p>
  To be able to talk about cyber attacks from a rhetorical perspetcive, we need to be aware of the miscommunication between the technical sphere and the humanities. The tech sphere gets frustrated with humanities because they discuss tech without understanding terminology, which ends up creating issues of credibility. The humanties are in turn frustrated with the technical side's lack of nuance, and refusal to think about anything in ways that isn't "logical." Offensive cyber attacks are examined through functional qualifiers first, and rightly so, because we need to understand how they work to mitigate them. Security has a good technical understanding on how the attacks work, but that knowledge in itself is not sufficent to prevent them. Many defensive responses to the attacks are troubling, with research used solely to check off a box when making a program to satisfy audits, without a deeper understanding of <i>why</i> the attacks work communicatively. The resulting trainings are left with a lack of creativity in delivery, and the language feels patornizing at best.

  A perfect example of this frustration and miscommunication is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07350198.2011.552378" target="_blank">an article I found in Rhetoric Review</a> discussing phishing in terms of terrorism and racial violence, moving into suggestions that we rename phishing to digital forgery so we can understand the motive behind it better. The problem is not with the cultural analysis, but that digital forgery is a collection of sub-fields within cybersecurity. Renaming phishing to digital forgery exists in some situations like clonephishing, but cannot be applied as a generality. It's easy to see how the author came up with that idea. I performed a cursory Google search which produced data about digital forgery not related to cybersecurity at all, but related to physical forgery using a computer. But my husband, who works in cybersecurity, gets vastly different results directly related to security's definitions of digital forgery. Even cybersecurity resources online describe what the author was talking about as data forgery, while <a href="https://cybersecurity-excellence-awards.com/candidates/data-forgery-protection-technology/" target="_blank">digital forgery</a> includes things like SSL certificates, blockchain forgery, and can even encompass things seemingly undigital such as counterfitting inkjet printers. Without being involved in the security discourse community, it's no surprise that the author was unaware of this specific deliniation.

  It's no different than referring to a politician's "rhetoric" with the underlying implication that rhetoric is manipulative, untrustworthy, or inflammitory. This cultural definition is frustrating for people within rhetoric, and it damages the credibility of rhetoric to those who aren't familiar with it. Rhetoricians know that rhetoric is not simply deception, but is about identification, meaning-making, and understanding communicative practices. Terminology is inherently specific within disciplines to define advanced terms, and so the difficulty in merging opposed fields is learning how to communicate cooperatively.

  In order to combat these growing frustrations, scholars must be willing to step in between domains to become experts in both fields. It's uncomfortable, and a lot of work, but the work is worth doing. If we could discover how to coopertively communicate between rhetoric and cybersecurity, the potential for adeeper understanding of how cyber attacks work on both offensive and defensive sides creates more effective training for everyone, making all of us safer in the end.
