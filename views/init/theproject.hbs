A computer is a compilation of symbols that make a system we understand and use for our own benefit. Humans make meaning from the act of communication with the computer, but the computer must translate its functions in order to be understood by the human - to be <i>meaningful</i> to the human. This idea of identification and understanding is apparent even when thinking about programming languages; many modern languages use interpreters to execute high-level (human readable) code freely without having to compile it into low-level (machine) code first. Programming interpreters make "meaning" to the computer based on what's given in high-level code, translating it to low-level, and then producing a program that a human can make meaning from. The computer is inherently rhetorical, as is every other communicative process involved with one. This is one of the ideas where digital rhetoric spawns from - the relationship between writers and audience through the use of digital media. In this spirit, I am focusing my project on one of my long-term interests - cyber attacks - looking at both phishing emails and existing security awareness training materials to understand how the language operates within both offensive and defensive techniques.

  Often understanding of these attacks is made through behavioral science, psychology, and social engineering,  both examining how attacks are executed and how to prevent them. I say we need to go a step further and invoke rhetoric to help us understand how these communications work, and security professionals and hobbiysts would be wise to pay attention to rhetorical devices present within cyber threats. To clarify that when I discuss rhetoric here, I refer to modern rhetoric, not the traditional "art of persuasion" rhetoric. While rhetoric does focus on appeals and persuasion, modern rhetoric goes further, examining how symbol-systems shape the way people interpet reality and make meaning within it. A symbol-system can be a multitude of things - the language you're reading this in, an ideological system like religion or government, or even something like bytecode. Knowing these symbol-systems are inherently influential, modern rhetoricians focus on two-way communication as opposed to a one-way influence on the intended party. Rhetoric seeks to actively engage participants in the public sphere, while making meaning from those interactions to understand how language acts and shapes the world around it. Simply put, rhetoric is the act of meaning-making through language. Because of this, rhetoricians can enhance the way that computer and cybersecurity is discussed and understood through the very act of rhetoric itself. By focusing on communicative practices in both offensive and defensive positions, this act enhances what's already available, and creates space for new studies.
