  A computer is a compilation of symbols that make up a system we understand and use for our own benefit. Much like language, people make meaning from the act of communication with the computer, but the computer must translate its functions (its own language) in order to be understood - to be meaningful - to the person interacting with it. This idea of identification and understanding is apparent also when thinking about programming languages, and we could assume that even by virtue of having language in the name, it would reference some form of communication relevant to our own. Many modern languages use interpreters to execute high-level (human readable) code freely without having to compile it into low-level (machine) code first. Programming interpreters make "meaning" to the computer based on what's given in high-level code, translating it to low-level, and then producing a program that a human can make meaning from. The computer is inherently rhetorical, as is every other communicative process involved with one. This is one of the ideas where digital rhetoric spawns from - the relationship between writers and audience using digital media. In this spirit, I am focusing rhetsec_ on one of my long-term interests - cyber attacks - focusing my portfolio section on phishing emails as an offensive tactic. The rhetsec_ project seeks to understand how the language operates within both offensive and defensive techniques, and so more analyses will come after the master's portion of the project is completed.

  Within the field of cybersecurity, examination of attacks on a non-technical level are generally made through behavioral science, psychology, and social engineering. They use these disciplines to examine how attacks are executed and how to prevent them, while attempting to understand how human nature helps or hinders the process. But I say that we need to go a step further and invoke rhetoric to help us understand <i>how</i> these communications work. Security professionals and hobbyists would be wise to pay attention to rhetorical devices present within cyber threats. To clarify that when I discuss rhetoric here, I refer to modern rhetoric, not the traditional "art of persuasion" rhetoric. While rhetoric does focus on appeals and persuasion, modern rhetoric goes further, examining how symbol-systems shape the way people interpret reality and make meaning within it. A symbol-system can be a multitude of things - the language you're reading this in, an ideological system like religion or government, or even something like bytecode. Knowing these symbol-systems are inherently influential, modern rhetoricians focus on two-way communication as opposed to a one-way influence on the intended party. Rhetoric seeks to actively engage participants in the public sphere, while making meaning from those interactions to understand how language acts and shapes the world around it. Simply put, rhetoric is the act of meaning-making through language. Because of this, rhetoricians can enhance the way that computer and cybersecurity is discussed and understood through the very act of rhetoric itself. By focusing on communicative practices in both offensive and defensive positions, this act enhances what's already available, and creates space for new studies.

  To be able to talk about cyber attacks from a rhetorical perspective, we need to be aware of the miscommunication between the technical sphere and the humanities. The tech sphere gets frustrated with humanities because they discuss tech without understanding terminology, which ends up creating issues of credibility. The humanities are in turn frustrated with the technical side's lack of nuance, and refusal to think about anything in ways that isn't "logical." Offensive cyber attacks are examined through functional qualifiers first, and rightly so, because we need to understand how they work to mitigate them. Security has a good technical understanding on how the attacks work, but that knowledge in itself is not sufficient to prevent them. Many defensive responses to the attacks are troubling, with research used solely to check off a box when making a program to satisfy audits, without a deeper understanding of why the attacks work communicatively. The resulting trainings are left with a lack of creativity in delivery, and the language feels patronizing at best.

  A perfect example of this frustration and miscommunication is <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jensen, Kyle. A Matter of Concern: Kenneth Burke, Phishing, and the Rhetoric of National Insecurity, Rhetoric Review, 30:2, 170-190, 2011.">an article I found in Rhetoric Review discussing phishing in terms of terrorism and racial violence</a>, moving into suggestions that we rename phishing to digital forgery so we can understand the motive behind it better. The problem is not with the cultural analysis, but that digital forgery is a collection of sub-fields within cybersecurity. Renaming phishing to digital forgery exists in some situations like clonephishing, but cannot be applied as a generality. It's easy to see how the author came up with that idea. I performed a cursory Google search which produced data about digital forgery not related to cybersecurity at all but related to physical forgery using a computer. But my husband, who works in cybersecurity, gets vastly different results directly related to security's definitions of digital forgery. Even cybersecurity resources online describe what the author was talking about as data forgery, while digital forgery includes things like SSL certificates, blockchain forgery, and can even encompass things seemingly undigital such as counterfeiting inkjet printers. Without being involved in the security discourse community, it's no surprise that the author was unaware of this specific delineation.

  It's no different than referring to a politician's "rhetoric" with the underlying implication that rhetoric is manipulative, untrustworthy, or inflammatory. This cultural definition is frustrating for people in rhetoric, and it damages the credibility of rhetoric to those who aren't familiar with it. Rhetoricians know that rhetoric is not simply deception, but is about identification, meaning-making, and understanding communicative practices. Terminology is inherently discipline specific when defining advanced terms, and so the difficulty in merging opposed fields is learning how to communicate cooperatively.
</p>
<p>
  In order to combat these growing frustrations, scholars must be willing to step in between domains to become experts in both fields. It's uncomfortable, and a lot of work, but the work is worth doing. If we could discover how to cooperatively communicate between rhetoric and cybersecurity, the potential for a deeper understanding of how cyber attacks work on both offensive and defensive sides creates more effective training for everyone, making all of us safer in the end. Rhetsec_ aims to establish a language about security that both groups of people can use for their own benefit, whatever that benefit may be.
