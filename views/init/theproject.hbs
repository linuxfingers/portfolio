  Humans make meaning from the act of communicating with a computer, but because a computer needs to translate its own language to be readable to someone interacting with it, we must understand why the language itself is important. Much like natural languages, the idea of identification and understanding is present in programming languages, with their structure inherently philosophical. Interpreters execute high-level (human readable) code freely without having to compile it into low-level (machine) code first. Interpreters make "meaning" to the computer based on what's given in high-level code, translating it to machine language, and producing a program that a human can interface with and make meaning from. Essentially, it's the translation of abstract symbols into a formal (programming) language, something computer scientists and linguists would be familiar with through <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sipser, Michael. Introduction to the Theory of Computation.">automata theory</a>. A more easily readable example of this comes from Larry Wall, creator of the Perl programming language. Trained as a linguist, he's brought a unique perspective into Perl, using theories of natural language to influence how his programming language operates. A detailed expansion of his ideas on natural language concepts in Perl can be found <a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/natural.html">here</a>.

  Understanding then that a computer is a symbol-system that we interact with, it becomes inherently rhetorical. This is one of the ideas where digital rhetoric spawns from - the relationship between writers and audience using digital media. In this spirit, I am initially focusing on one of my long-term interests - cyber attacks - with the initial work on phishing emails as an offensive tactic. More examinations will follow, as the rhetsec_ project seeks to understand how the language operates within both offensive attacks and defensive techniques.

  Security researchers seek to understand how human nature influences cyber attacks through behavioral science, psychology, and social engineering. They use these disciplines to examine how attacks are executed and how to prevent them, but I say that we need to go a step further and invoke rhetoric to help us understand <i>how</i> these communications work. To clarify that when I discuss rhetoric here, I refer to modern rhetoric, not the traditional "art of persuasion" rhetoric. While rhetoric does focus on appeals and persuasion, modern rhetoric goes further, examining how symbol-systems shape the way people interpret reality and make meaning. A symbol-system can be a multitude of things - the language you're reading this in, an ideological system like religion or government, or even something like bytecode. Knowing these symbol-systems are inherently influential, modern rhetoricians focus on two-way communication as opposed to a one-way influence on the intended party. Rhetoric seeks to actively engage participants in the public sphere, while making meaning from those interactions to understand how language acts and shapes the world around it. Simply put, rhetoric is the act of meaning-making through language, and rhetoricians can enhance the way that computer and cybersecurity is discussed and understood through the very act of rhetoric itself. By focusing on communicative practices in both offensive and defensive positions, this act enhances what's already available, and creates space for new studies.

  To understand why this cross-disciplinary study needs to occur, it helps to be aware of the miscommunication between the technical sphere and the humanities. Almost like the age-old trope of science versus humanities, technical researchers and professionals sphere are frustrated when they discover research on technology from an outsider's perspective that's evident the terminology isn't understood. This creates issues of credibility and easy dismissal of existing research. The humanities are frustrated with the technical sphere's side's lack of nuance, and nonacceptance of anything that isn't "logical." Security has an excellent technical understanding on how attacks work, but that functional knowledge is not sufficient enough to prevent them. Many defensive responses to cyber attacks, such as security awareness training programs, are troubling, being used to check off a box when making a program to satisfy audits without a deeper understanding of why the attacks work on a human level. While some companies are looking to change that, many materials still are left with a lack of creativity in delivery, and can feel patronizing at best.

  A perfect example of this frustration and miscommunication is <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jensen, Kyle. A Matter of Concern: Kenneth Burke, Phishing, and the Rhetoric of National Insecurity, Rhetoric Review, 30:2, 170-190, 2011.">an article I found in Rhetoric Review discussing phishing in terms of terrorism and racial violence</a>, moving into suggestions that we rename phishing to digital forgery so we can understand the motive behind it better. The problem is not with the cultural analysis, but that digital forgery is a collection of sub-fields within computer science, forensics, and cybersecurity. Renaming phishing to digital forgery exists in some situations like clonephishing, but cannot be applied as a generality. It's easy to see how the author came up with that idea, as when I performed a cursory web search, it produced data about digital forgery not related to cybersecurity at all, but related to physical forgery using a computer. But my husband, who works in cybersecurity, gets vastly different results directly related to security's definitions of digital forgery. Even cybersecurity resources online describe what the author was talking about as data forgery, while digital forgery includes things like SSL certificates, blockchain forgery, and can even encompass things seemingly undigital such as counterfeiting inkjet printers. Without being involved in the security discourse community, it's no surprise that the author was unaware of this specific delineation.

  It's much like referring to a politician's "rhetoric" with the underlying implication that rhetoric is manipulative, untrustworthy, or inflammatory. This cultural definition is frustrating for people in rhetoric, and it damages the credibility of rhetoric to those who aren't familiar with it. Rhetoricians know that rhetoric is not simply deception, but is about identification, meaning-making, and understanding communicative practices. Terminology is inherently discipline specific when defining advanced terms, and so the difficulty in merging opposed fields is learning how to communicate cooperatively.
</p>
<p>
  In order to combat these growing frustrations, scholars must be willing to step in between domains to become experts in both fields. It's uncomfortable, and a lot of work, but the work is worth doing. If we could discover how to cooperatively communicate between rhetoric and cybersecurity, the potential for a deeper understanding of how cyber attacks work on both offensive and defensive sides creates more effective training for everyone, making all of us safer in the end. Rhetsec_ aims to establish a language about security that both groups of people can use for their own benefit, whatever that benefit may be.
