    Phase one of this project focuses on research. In this section, I make available rhetorical analysis of various phishing email categories and security awareness training materials. Each section will have a main page with a general description of the work contained within, and how I arrived at those conclusions. Within each section are subsections of the specififc analyses done. I intend to use the information learned here to produce content for Phase 2.
