      <dt class="col-sm-3">Bulk Phishing</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9 text-truncate">This is the most common type of attack, and the least sophisticated. It involves impersonation of a corporation or organization and threatening or urgent sounding language to obtain information and credentials. These emails tend not to be personalized, and may only reference general information. The example provided by indiana.edu is an example of this type of attack.</dd>

      <dt class="col-sm-3">Clone Phishing</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">This attack takes an email and copies it word for word, changing links to malicious sites. The sending email is generally spoofed, so it looks legitimate to the unaware.</dd>

      <dt class="col-sm-3">Dropbox/Google Doc Phishing</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">These attacks mimic requests to share documents via these services, prompting users to enter login credentials, which allows the attackers to gain access to their files. This very type of attack happened to SCSU just a few years ago!</dd>

      <dt class="col-sm-3">Pharming</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">A technologically sophisticated phishing attack that doesn't rely on someone falling for bait. The "pharming" code is injected into a user's computer from a clicked link, which redirects someone to a malicious site using a technique called DNS cache poisoning.
        <br>This attack changes the information stored within various caches (places website addresses and other data is stored for quick access later) and redirects the user to a site which looks legitimate in both URL and design. <br>

      For example, it changes your cache so that wellsfargo.com's IP address is 169.63.0.12 when it's actually 159.45.66.143. That means you're logging into the malicious site until that cache is flushed, even if you type in wellsfargo.com yourself. It's virtually undetectable after it's happened, and you won't know until after it's happened that your information has been compromised.</dd>

      <dt class="col-sm-3">Malspam</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">.......</dd>

      <dt class="col-sm-3">Spearphishing</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">A more sophisticated attack, this uses publicly available data, such as the user's personal details and work information, to boost the sender's ethos in an attempt to make a user feel they are legitimately connected.</dd>

      <dt class="col-sm-3">Whaling</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-9">As the name implies, this is a type of spearphishing attack aimed at bigger fish - high-level executives - which is often effective as they often do not take part in security awareness training with their employees.</dd>
