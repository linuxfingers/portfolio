    "Lupulin compounds in the hops plant (Humulus lupulus) have been studied in recent years for their potential antioxidant properties. The reaction with DPPHâ€¢ (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) was used to determine the antioxidant activity of the hop extracts with Simcoe hop cones and pellets was investigated. This showed a rapid decrease in radicals over a period of 30 minutes."
