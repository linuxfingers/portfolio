    <p>Rhetsec_ is a project is written for researchers interested in new ways to think about communication within computer security using rhetoric. It's also written for hackers by trade or hobby who want a unique perspective that isn't affiliated or biased by large corporations. It's a space to talk candidly about unconventional topics, to share ideas between scholars and hackers about the offensive and defensive side of cyber attacks using a language both groups understand.

      My <a href="#" id="portfolioFolder" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#portfolioModal">master's portfolio</a> focuses on phishing as an offensive tactic. After that's completed, rhetsec_ will explore the defensive side, looking at security awareness training. It will also look at other offensive and defensive tactics later, seeking to become a comprehensive repository of issues in cybersecurity interpreted through a rhetorical lens.
