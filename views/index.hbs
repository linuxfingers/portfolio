    Hello, and welcome. I'm Jenny Lynn, a Rhetoric & Writing Master's candidate at St. Cloud State University. I've thought a lot about both rhetoric and cybersecurity, and I believe a meaningful relationship exists between these two diciplines - one I believe should be examined seriously if we want to understand security from other vantage points. I'm starting that conversation with this project: an examination on various aspects and issues within cybersecurity through the lens of rhetoric. Since I am interested in digital spaces, I felt that my work is more suited to a digital space, hence this portfolio.

    Currently, access to content is restricted to my committee. I expect an approval for publication near December 2019. I intend on releasing my project here when I am completed, and want to open dialogue about what I hope to be an exciting intersectional study. If you have questions about what I am working on, or have worked on in the past (or even just want to say hello,) check out the about folder for ways to contact me.</a> I'm more than happy to talk about anything I'm working on. &#9835;
