    Hello, and welcome. I'm Jenny Lynn, a Rhetoric & Writing Master's candidate at St. Cloud State University. I've thought a lot about both rhetoric and cybersecurity, and I believe a meaningful relationship exists between these two diciplines that should be examined to understand security from other vantage points. I'm starting that conversation with this project: an examination on various aspects and issues within cybersecurity through the lens of rhetoric.

    Currently, access to most of the content is restricted to my committee. I expect an approval for publication near December 2019. I intend on releasing my project here when I am finished, and want to open dialogue about what I hope to be an exciting intersectional study. I plan on continuing research after this is finished, and will house what I find here.</p>

  <p>
    If you have questions about what I am working on, or have worked on in the past (or even just want to say hello,) check out the about folder for ways to contact me.</a> I'm more than happy to talk about anything I'm working on. &#9835;
