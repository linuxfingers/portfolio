      Rhetsec_ is a new way of thinking about cybersecurity, written for researchers looking to understand communication techniques in computer security, and for hackers by trade or hobby who want a perspective that isn't corporately biased. It's a space to talk candidly about unconventional topics, and to share ideas about the offensive and defensive side of cyber attacks using a language both groups understand.

      This project started as my <a href="#" id="portfolioFolder" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#portfolioModal">master's portfolio</a>, which focuses on phishing as an offensive cyber attack. My plan is continued exploration of offensive and defensive techniques, examining current issues in cybersecurity using a rhetorician's perspective.

      In addition to the rhetsec_ project, you'll find information on other writing and research work I've done. I've also included creative works such as music, poetry, narrative, and visual arts. I hope you enjoy what you find here!
