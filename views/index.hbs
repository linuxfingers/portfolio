      Rhetsec_ is a new way of thinking about cybersecurity. It's a project written for researchers looking to understand communication techniques in computer security, and for hackers by trade or hobby who want a perspective that isn't corporately biased. It's a space to talk candidly about unconventional topics, and to share ideas about the offensive and defensive side of cyber attacks using a language both groups understand.

      This project started as my <a href="#" id="portfolioFolder" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#portfolioModal">master's portfolio</a>, which focuses on phishing as an offensive tactic. After that's completed, the project will grow and explore other offensive and defensive tactics with the goal of bringing a rhetorician's perspective into existing cybersecurity discourse.

      In addition to the rhetsec_ project, you'll find my portfolio full of information on other types of writing and research work I've done. I've also included my creative works such as music, writing, and visual arts. I hope you enjoy what you find here!
