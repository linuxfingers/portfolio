    This website hosts my upcoming master's portfolio project, among other bits I've worked on. I'm currently a master's candidate for a Rhetoric and Writing degree at Saint Cloud State University, and I've chosen a website portfolio over a thesis because I feel that the type of work I have been interested in [digital spaces] is more suited to a digital space than a standard thesis. I am much more open to the idea of having easily accessible knowledge and building a community, rather than hiding behind paywalls or other types of barriers. I am a huge proponent of Open Source, and feel that education should follow the same path.

    I've thought a lot about both rhetoric and cybersecurity, and I believe a meaningful relationship exists between them. It's the perfect marriage of disciplines, and I feel it should be focused on seriously if we want to promote technological literacy - not just in the workplace, but overall. I aim to push that conversation in the right direction with this project. Currently, access to portfolio content is restricted to my committee. I expect an approval for publication date near December 2019. I intend on releasing my project to the wild when I have approval. If you have questions about what I am working on, or have worked on in the past (or even just want to say hello,) please see my <a href="/about/jen">about me</a> page for contact methods.</a> I'm more than happy to talk about anything I'm working on. &#9835;
