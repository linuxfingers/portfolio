      For this section, I made a few different pages as a basic mock up of how the phishing simulation training would work. Since these pages will be demonstrative, I'll talk a bit about their function and how I made them here.

    <p>
      The login page link shows a login page I made based off of the <a href="" target+"_blank" title"This is the REAL site, you're safe here.">real Experian login page.
    <p>
        It doesn't collect any data in a database, so no information put into <i>this</i> page is saved. That's obviously not the case in a real phishing attack, but it looks almost real enough I needed to provide a disclaimer. For added effect, I purchased a domain to mask this website's URL, cleverly named <a href="http://strch33z.ws">stch33z.ws</a>. (String Cheese, for those who don't speak 1337.) I did this mostly for fun, but also because checking link redirects is an important part of detecting a phishing email, and what better way than to drive the point home by using what looks like an incredibly sketchy website URL?
      <p>
      <p>
        Initially, I was going to make a variety of login pages to demonstrate how they could look, but decided to showcase this one as I realized mutiple methods would be redundant for a rhetoric project. Since this <i>is</i> a mock-up for my business, I'll design more of these in the future.
