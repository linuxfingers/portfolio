<h1>&Vert; current state of affairs</h1>
<p>
  Training tends to focus on remediating functional concerns as opposed to helping users learn about the problems from a critical-thinking perspective. This tendency to fix the problem by applying functional solutions is ingrained in the creators due to years of experience with both the subject matter, and prior education. Security professionals think about how to fix it functionally, usually without addressing human factors such as agency.
</p>
<p>
  Do these training programs exist solely because they know that companies have to have a Security Awareness Training program?
  Are the companies who require these types of programs for their employees concerned with managing security risks, or is it a checkbox to tick off for compliance, and therefore not as scrutinizing of the content presented?
</p>
<p>
  Who profits from users being literate against phishing campaigns? The companies and the security awareness training programs! SAT cannot be something that is a one-time deal and be done. While education should be treated as a process, not a goal, I suspect the reason for continuous subscriptions to these services is about meeting audit metrics, managing the loss of training via employee turnover, and other business worries over scholarly pursuits.

<h3># what's happening in sat?</h3>

  KnowBe4 offeres a customizable trial that sets up a security awareness program in under ten minutes, so I decided to to create an account to test it and see what kinds of information was readily available. Since I was familiar with their tools from people in different industries, it felt natural to examine their materials. What also really grabbed me was their association with Kevin Mitnick. If you're not familiar with Kevin, he is a world-famous hacker who spent years as a fugitive on the FBI's Most Wanted list turned white-hat security consultant. He is the CEO of Mitnick Security Consulting and Knowbe4's Chief Hacking Officer. Having Kevin as a part of the KnowBe4 team was a huge selling point for me to examine them. Lastly, their focus on the human element of security being the biggest compromiser feels in line with my project, and so wanted to understand their methodology for their training materials for my own sake and to have a better understanding about more progressive security awareness programs. They offer regular webinars I've looked at too. Pretty neat stuff.
</p>
<p>
  SANS was an obvious choice for me to look at, as so much of the work I did in my rhetoric design course focused on using and remaking their materials. They're an industry leader in terms of certifications and training and generally respected within the community. I also was curious as to why they are so well regarded for security training and wanted to delve a bit deeper into their methodologies to see what gives them that status. Much of their training content is locked behind personal contact with a representative.
</p>
<p>
  In training materials, there's a clear distinction between user and presenter, as if they treat users as being functionally literate, without really hoping that they grow beyond that. These programs often say they want the users to learn, but the environment doesn't seem conducive to producing critical thinking. These training materials operate at an elementary level of literacy - functional literacy. Since functional literacy is concerned with providing primary education that's necessary to complete essential functions, these training programs seek to educate at the shallowest of levels. What instantly stuck out to me was Knoblauch's explanation of functionalist perspectives in terms of technological progressivism, which I promptly connected to the trope of the "changing nature of business due to technology" so prevalent in security awareness training materials:
</p>
<p>
  "The rhetoric of technological progressivism is often leavened with a mixture of fear and patriotism...in order to defend a social program that maintains managerial classes...in their customary places while outfitting workers with the minimal reading and writing skills needed for usefulness to the modern information economy." [Politics of Literacy and Education]
</p>
<p>
  The problem is that these programs only educate employees just enough to keep the business operations running smoothly, without threatening the positions of power held by those above them. If the worker doesn't know anything more than what's needed for essential functions, then they're useful inside the box their employer created for them. While I understand the desire to keep workers "in their place" for efficiency, training individuals like this creates situations in which those who are more knowledgable or receptive about the topics at hand may feel patronized, bored, or turned off from the idea altogether.
</p>
<p>
  If what Knoblauch states is true, that literacy is embedded in ideological dispositions of those who use, profit, and enforce it as a social requirement, it's easy to see where this power dynamic begins. Because who profits from users being literate against phishing campaigns? The companies and the security awareness training programs! Security awareness training cannot be something that is a one-time deal and be done, but I don't believe it's for the goal of promoting literacy.  While education should be treated as a process, not a goal, I suspect the reason for continuous subscriptions to these services is about meeting audit metrics, managing the loss of training via employee turnover, and other business worries over scholarly pursuits.
</p>
<p>
  Functional literacy isn't meant to inspire creative thinking and new ideas, and helps keep employees in their designated roles for maximized efficiency. But if "lower" employees thinking critically about situations they're in at work, it may make security awareness training more meaningful, and could help them look at unrelated problems in new ways.

</p>
<p>
  SANS states in their FAQs that "the courses were developed through the community consensus of hundreds of administrators, security managers, and information security professionals, and address both security fundamentals and the in-depth technical aspects of the most crucial areas of information security." I could not find exact information about the individual courses, or who worked on what topic, as that access was restricted. SANS builds their ethos on the individuals involved, and doesn't really say much about what they're doing, relying almost entirely on their reputation of being "the best" to sell products.
</p>
<p>
  In a SANS brochure titled "A Hero's Guide to Victory," they state:
</p>
<p>
  "We rely on the trifecta of world-renowned cybersecurity instructors and experts who produce the core training concepts, ensuring you have the best possible training available:
  <li>
    Cybersecurity Subject Matter Experts: These industry authorities have outlined the most critical threats and continue to create quality curriculum to teach tactics to negate security risks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Learning Experience Design Experts: Adult-learning specialists who make the training easily digestible and improve learner engagement and memory retention.
  </li>
  <li>
    Client Success & Program Customization Experts: Our global team plans, deploys, and manages the growth of awareness programs of any size of an organization. They work closely at every step to execute program goals."
  </li>
</p>
<p>
  The information sounds great; it's built to sell, and promotes a thriving security environment postured through synergistic technologies, recaptiualizing an informed workforce that can tackle any click-and-mortar mindshare that comes their way. Wait...what? (But yeah, that's really what it soundes like.) A closer look at the language clearly shows that they are using their ethos as the "definitive" security company to prop up their product, with little description on what their product does, or how it is effective at preventing phishing attacks. I understand this brochure is a sales pitch, but I am a bit dismayed not to find any research linking their claims of efficacy in the brochure, or on their website.
</p>
<p>
  In an email followup for requesting the brochure, they stated:
</p>
<p>
  "The Hero's Guide to Awareness Program Victory is a resource we created to help your organization make the very best choice in training content. Obviously, you're the security hero and know exactly what makes your organization unique. The company culture, the level of understanding, even the languages your learners speak play a role into choosing the right training program. Sometimes, though, even the best heroes need a little help. That's where this guide comes in."
</p>
<p>
  Who are they talking to? Me, a security hero? Well, goodness that's great, but I'm still not getting an accurate picture of *what* I'm reading, learning, or potentially buying. So to see "under the hood," I requested a demo of their phishing product. I've been running into the issue of content not being provided without scheduling a one-on-one demo. I've circumvented some of that with my business email, while some companies have not cared that I am a student seeking information, and allowed me to utilize free demos for tools with limited functionality. But getting access to a few of the "big names" in security awareness training has been difficult. My favorite response so far has been from SANS, stating:

  It's very clear it was still a sales pitch even in my abjection from SANS. I'm not sure how (or why) as a student I would contact my organization's executive of products in order to have a demo of their products for my research. I'm also amazed at the suggestion to inform them they could recieve a significant discount as an educational institution for their trainings. It left a strange taste in my mouth, especially as a person who enjoys SANS and what they do - <i>why</i> don't they want me to see the content as a student interested in learning how things work? What are they trying to hide? This denial of service is what pushed me to dig deeper into the idiosyncracies of what being an industry-leader actually means in security, with results both fascinating and disappointing which has been helpful in understanding what a lot of the problems are in existing security awareness training. This incident, in conjunction with discoveries made analyzing some content from another company's training respository, awakened a desire to "get to the bottom" of what's really going on with these organizations and how they create and sell their training. Something feels amiss, and I want to find out more.
