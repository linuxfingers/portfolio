<h1>&Vert; quizzes</h1>

<p>
  The second module I looked at was a game designed to teach security training. Gamification has become quite common in academic settings, and one I've used with my own students in the past, so I was happy to see it utilized for private training, as well. The game, designed by The Security Awareness Company, aims to have users select a device (computer or phone) and select whether or not the presented message was a real phishing scam. As I progressed through the materials, I realized how easy it was to use. Gamification of security awareness training is interesting. I played a few games, and it was "fun," but felt patronizing.

<p>
  Most content is about phishing. Sometime's it's on security. or testing in the middle of a lecture.

<h3># language</h3>

  So easy, a middle schooler could understand it. Problem is, these are professionals. Doesn't exactly make the test helpful, I think.

<h3># thoughts on gamification</h3>
<p>
  Turning learning into a game is fun - we do it all the time in academia. And sure, it does seem to have a more positive effect than simple lectures.

<h3># efficacy</h3>

  Do tests really help people learn? Personally, I'm on the side that quizzes don't foster a positive learning environment. Test anxiety doesn't help in a work environment either, even if the scores aren't saved. So what is the rhetorical merit of having a quiz on phishing or security if the "student" hasn't been able to study the material? How does random testing fit in with whatever pedagogical method they're going for?

  Some people might disagree with me, that's fine. I'll talk about that here in more detail later.
