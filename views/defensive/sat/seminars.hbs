  Basically like lectures, but about computer and data security. Includes live presentations, as well as slideshows and PDF documents to be read at a later date.

  The difficuly in delivering this kind of training is that it's a group of people not caring about the topic at all, but being mandated to sit through your lecture at least once a year while they've got Really Important Thingsâ„¢ going on. (It's funny, because that's what it felt like teaching English 191 sometimes.)
