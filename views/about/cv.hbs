          <!--<li>Ahh, community college. The humble birthplace of my educational career. I loved this program so much (and admittedly still miss it at times.) After showing a lot of promise, my advisor recommended I apply to St. Scholastica through their IWIT program to get into a bachelor's program. I did, and was accepted, and so transferred after my first year here.</li>-->
